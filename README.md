# LeetCode

A personal space to track my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and to publish my solutions to coding problems. The goal is consistency, clarity, and learning through practice.

## Purpose
- Build strong DSA fundamentals through regular problem solving.
- Keep clean, readable solutions for future reference.
- Share my approach and learnings in a structured way.

## What You Will Find
- Solutions organized by topic and/or platform.
- Each solution includes the problem, approach, and complexity notes when helpful.
- Incremental improvements and alternative approaches as I learn.

## Structure
The repository will be organized as it grows, for example:
- `arrays/`
- `strings/`
- `linked-lists/`
- `trees/`
- `graphs/`
- `dynamic-programming/`

## Notes
- Solutions are written for learning, not golfing.
- Expect iterative refinements as I revisit problems.

## Contact
If you want to discuss a solution or suggest improvements, feel free to open an issue.
